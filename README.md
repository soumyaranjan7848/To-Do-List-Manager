• Overview

   •  The Task Management App is a command-line interface (CLI) Python application that allows users to manage tasks effectively.
   •  Users can add, update, delete, and view tasks using simple text-based commands. The app operates in a continuous loop, processing user commands until the user exits.

• Program Structure

  • The app consists of a single Python function, task(), which orchestrates all operations.
  
 • Usage
      •To use the app, run the Python script and follow the on-screen prompts to manage tasks. Choose from the provided options to add, update, delete, or view tasks.
       When finished, select the exit option to close the application.

 • Error Handling
      • Currently, the application handles invalid task operations gracefully by checking if tasks exist before updating or deleting.
        However, it could benefit from additional error handling for non-numeric input when choosing operations.

 • Conclusion
      • This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Task Management App. 
        Each component and its functionality are detailed, providing clear instructions on how the app is structured and how to interact with it. 
        Future improvements could include robust error handling and data persistence.
